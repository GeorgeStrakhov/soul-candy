# Bubbles

- When I cease and desist,
And forever disperse,
Will there still be a thing left of me?
...
- When you stop to exist
You'll no longer resist
Being everything else you can be.
...
- When you stop being you,
Skies will never be blue,
Winds will always be out of their breath.
...
- When I stop being me,
I'll be all you can see:
What is gone is a part of what's left.
