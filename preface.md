#Preface

Dear Reader!

Before we start, let's make one thing absolutely clear:

This book is not a medicine, it's a candy.

I don't think that what's written here is truth. I am not advocating anything. I have nothing to sell. I am an entertainer.

The point of view at life that is presented in this book is [partly] what helps me be one of the happiest people I know. It helps me, so it may very well help you as well. Or not. Try and find out.

Enjoy your soul candy, but don't take too much at a time.

Hugs,
George

p.s.
Most of the things in here are pretty obvious. But it's the obvious things that we often forget. None of the things in here are original thoughts. They are all borrowed from a wide range of people, famous and not. Some of them are cited in "read more" sections. Others please forgive me.
