#Scattered Snippets

* be confused (confusion that leads to curiosity, not fear or anger)
* give (hyde - gift as the enabler of connections. gifts that grow when shared.)
* unfocus (artistic approach to self)
* listen to the noise // embrace imperfection (karsavin, onion-like world)

* repeat (mandelbrot + feynman) - force of nature? Reproduction.
The amusing part of life: the whole thing is just reproduction. No matter how complicated the business is, the main point is to do it again!"
- Richard Feynman
Side Effects! - focus on the process and side-effects will come. Frankl.

* make something

Frederick P. Brooks: I think that ability for subcreation is a necessary (and unavoidable) by-product of having consciousness. One can only have consciousness is he/she can produce something new thus in a way trespassing the boundaries of the initial self. In order to be able to create a new text (or anything else) and thus become conscious by being able to compare the [image of the] previous self with the new text and the [image of the] new self - one has to have at least two systems, two languages that are
 so different that new texts arise in pure attempt of translating old texts back and forth (см. Лотман, "Чему учатся люди)
 
So make things. Making things is a joy. "Making things is a joy - immensely satisfying. J.R.R. Tolkien suggests that God gave us the gift of subcreation, as a gift, just for joy. (...) Thanks to The Great Designer, who graciously grants us the means, the daily sustaining, and the joys of subcreation"



* be real (when you meet real people you sense it straight away. you are real)
* Leave no footprints (Lao Tzu)
* beware of time
* jump
* continue
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." 
- Winston Churchill

* You are it. You are the force of nature, whether you realize it or not. (the ultimate realization when you lose yourself in the process of finding things out or making things up)

* Dizzy freedom is half-freedom. You are dizzy because you are aware of the possibilities and you think of them in terms of the choices you have to make and the different outcomes that those choices may result in. Yet the ultimate freedom comes without dizziness. Because if you understand and appreciate that every outcome is in a way the same, then there is no reason to be dizzy.


"So the secret is just to say 'Yes!' and jump off from here. Then there is no problem. It means to be yourself, always yourself, without sticking to an old self."
"When you do something, you should burn yourself completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself."
"Zazen practice is the direct expression of our true nature. Strictly speaking, for a human being, there is no other practice than this practice; there is no other way of life than this way of life."[12]
"Take care of things, and they will take care of you."
- Shuryu Suzuki
