#Scattered Snippets

* be confused (confusion that leads to curiosity, not fear or anger)
* give (hyde - gift as the enabler of connections. gifts that grow when shared.)
* listen to the noise // embrace imperfection (karsavin, onion-like world)
* unfocus (artistic approach to self)

* run and find out (kipling + feynman. the pleasure of finding things out.)
The pleasure of finding things out is a pleasure of developing a better understanding of how things around you work. Say you hear a beautiful melody. If your ears are not shut - you can appreciate it. Yet if you manage to understand the underlying pattern of sound and silence that makes this melody possible - you can have so much more pleasure. This understanding can be intuitive or mathematical, or anything else. What's important is that it gives you a new dimension, the dimension of possibilities. Because now you are appreciating not just this melody, but all the other melodies made possible by this pattern. You can improvise, you can break the pattern and get back to it - and that's a lot of fun.

* repeat (mandelbrot + feynman) - force of nature? Reproduction.
The amusing part of life: the whole thing is just reproduction. No matter how complicated the business is, the main point is to do it again!"
- Richard Feynman
Side Effects! - focus on the process and side-effects will come. Frankl.

* make something
the world as a construction kit. Seymour Papert.
the pleasure of making things. 
The pleasure of making things up is a pleasure of creating new realities that can give contrast to the one you are used to. Say you are having a dream. If your dream is a pleasant one - you can appreciate it. Yet if you manage to realize that you are having a drea

Frederick P. Brooks: I think that ability for subcreation is a necessary (and unavoidable) by-product of having consciousness. One can only have consciousness is he/she can produce something new thus in a way trespassing the boundaries of the initial self. In order to be able to create a new text (or anything else) and thus become conscious by being able to compare the [image of the] previous self with the new text and the [image of the] new self - one has to have at least two systems, two languages that are
 so different that new texts arise in pure attempt of translating old texts back and forth (см. Лотман, "Чему учатся люди)
 
So make things. Making things is a joy. "Making things is a joy - immensely satisfying. J.R.R. Tolkien suggests that God gave us the gift of subcreation, as a gift, just for joy. (...) Thanks to The Great Designer, who graciously grants us the means, the daily sustaining, and the joys of subcreation"


* be real (when you meet real people you sense it straight away. you are real)
* beware of time
* jump
* continue
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."
