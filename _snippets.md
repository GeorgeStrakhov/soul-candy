#Scattered Snippets

* You are a verb. Do everything. If you let somebody else do it for you - it's bad for you and bad for them.

* You better choose your attitude, since there is nothing else you can choose.
* You are it. You are the force of nature, whether you realize it or not. (the ultimate realization when you lose yourself in the process of finding things out or making things up)
* Dizzy freedom is half-freedom. You are dizzy because you are aware of the possibilities and you think of them in terms of the choices you have to make and the different outcomes that those choices may result in. Yet the ultimate freedom comes without dizziness. Because if you understand and appreciate that every outcome is in a way the same, then there is no reason to be dizzy.
