#Preface

Dear Reader!

Before we start, let's make one thing absolutely clear:

I don't think that what's written here is truth. I am not advocating anything. I have nothing to sell. I am an entertainer.

This book is not a medicine, it's a candy. It's unlikely to stop your aging, but may help you enjoy the process a bit more.

The point of view at life presented in this book is [partly] what helps me be one of the happiest people I know. These thoughts make me happy, so they may very well do the trick for you as well. Or not. Try and find out.

Enjoy your soul candy, but don't take too much at a time.

Hugs,  
+G

p.s.  
Most of the things in here are pretty obvious. But it's the obvious that we forget too often. None of the things in here are original thoughts. They are all borrowed from a wide range of people, famous and not. Some of these people are cited in "read more" sections. Others, I hope, will forgive me.
