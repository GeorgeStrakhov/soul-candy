#Back to now

Over the course of evolution, humans have become extremely good at one thing that really matters to evolution: ability to survive.

The strategy that we've chosen though is very different from what our fellow animals do. We are not stronger or faster. Our skin is not thicker. We are more fragile than most of animals of similar size. In challenging environments or situations we are likely to die. But our strategy is to be one step ahead: we are very good at predicting and preventing (or avoiding) those situations.

The strategy of survival that has proven successful to us [so far] - is developing extraordinary ability to learn from previous experience (first personal, later cultural) and predict what can go wrong in the future.

May be good for survival, but definitely not so good for emotional wellbeing.
Our ability to constantly live in multiple futures that can go wrong has robbed us of the ability to live in the now.

In this sense you can say that unhappiness (in the form of constant worrying) is a necessary byproduct of the kind of intelligence that has evolved to dominate in us.

So are we bound to unhappiness then? Not necessarily. The trick is that we haven't [yet] lost senses. Nor have we lost the parts of the nervous system that is capable of living in the now. We simply don't associate the 'self', the 'I' with those parts.

The only thing that you need to do is to shift your consciousness from the worrying parts to the sensing parts. The choice of what you call yourself is yours at any given moment: do you want to the worrying one who lives in the future or do you want to be the sensing one who lives in the now?
