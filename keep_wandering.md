# Keep Wandering

Beware of everything you know!  
For to the ocean rivers flow  
And bring with them what once was known  
To be a solid, soulless stone.


Yet now it flows. Then it will grow.  
And then - it's you, before you know.  
Keep wandering! For wind that blows -   
Is all that anybody knows.
