# Look Back

Whenever you come to a fork in the road  
And there is nobody to lead the way  
And it's not clear, which road to take  
And which one you should but forever forgo

Stand back for a moment, and think of the times  
You had all too similar choices to make.  
Remember the roads you decided to take,   
Remember the ones you let go with a sigh.

Sit down with the man you were long ago,  
Forgive him for all the roads he forwent,  
Ask him,  which one he would like to go,  
Look back to remember, but not to regret.

Two roads will always be here to find:  
You've travelled them both already. Hence  
There is no reason for you to sigh -  
Which one you take makes no difference.
