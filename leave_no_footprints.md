# Leave no footprints

You are now or never.  
In between you're thrown.  
You are not together.  
You are not alone.  


You are not forever.  
Not in space or time.  
You are happening right now   
In between these lines.  


You are not your body.  
You are not your mind.  
There's no you in front of you   
And there's no you behind.  


There's no you to worry.  
There's no you to hide.  
There's no you inside you  
And there's no you outside.  


You are not your future.  
You are not your past.  
You are not the things you make -   
None of them will last.  


You were born this morning,  
Next one you'll be gone.  
Great man is one sentence.  
Still greater man is none.
