# Care for what matters

At any given moment in time, you can only truly care for just a few things. Start caring for things that do not really matter - and your caring soon runs out and there is none left for the things that do matter. I'm using the word "caring" vs. "paying attention" for a reason: we pay attention to things that we care for. Not the other way around.

So if I am running in a park and start caring about what other people think about me, then there is a good chance that I stop caring about the amazing bodily experience that I set out to enjoy in the first place. Once I stop caring about running, I stop paying attention to the feedback that my body and the path are giving to me. This leads to self-doubt, dissatisfaction and injury.
Yet if you ask me why I'm out in the park running, I'll tell you that it's because I enjoy movement or that I want to stay healthy. So, you see, there is a disconnect between what matters to me and what I care for.

The good thing is that if you accept the fact, that you can only truly care for very few things at any given moment of time, may be even just one thing, then you have to make a conscious choice about what you are going to care about in everything you do.

Even more importantly, you'll have to decide what you are not going to care about. And that is a very powerful thing to do.
