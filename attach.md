What brings you joy?
For me the list is quite diverse, at first sight at least:
* Simply being with people I love, doing something together
* Coming up with ideas and making things
* Reading things and understanding them
* Finding things out, solving interesting problems
* Learning new skills
* Walking, running, cycling or swimming, surrounded by nature
* Listening to music and playing music
* Wandering through busy cities

If you look closer though, there is a pattern.
First, they are all activities of some sort or another.
Second, all these activities are about immersing myself in something, resonating to something, being at one with something. They all involve some interaction.

True happiness is about being at one with something....
