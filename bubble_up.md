# Bubble Up

B1:  
When I cease and desist,  
And forever disperse,  
Will there still be a thing left of me?

B2:  
When you stop to exist  
You'll no longer resist  
Being everything else you can be.

B1:  
When you stop being you,  
Skies will never be blue,  
Winds will always be out of their breath.

B2:  
When I stop being me,  
I'll be all you can see:  
What is gone is a part of what's left.
