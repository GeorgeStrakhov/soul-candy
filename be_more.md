# Be more

![Be More](images/be_more.jpg)

Hold you breath for a moment.

How does it feel?

If I hold my breath for a bit longer, I forget everything about what I'm doing. Everything about what worries me. The only thing of immediate importance is resuming the simple act of being.

So, you see, 

Love result vs love process.

Stay Put. Do Less. Be More.
