#Tune In

All suffering comes from a [false] perception of being out of tune with the universe.

So when troubled, all you need to do is tune back in.
If you were an out-of-tune string on a well-tuned guitar, here is how you would tune yourself back in:

1. First, you would stop listening to yourself and start listening very carefully to what the rest of the guitar is doing. The trick here is to listen to the whole guitar, not just some strings.
2. Second, you would come back to yourself and try to find in all the different sounds that you are currently making the one that resonates the most with the rest of the guitar.
3. Third you would adjust your own vibrations in a way that would produce best possible resonance and harmony. The closer you are to being in-tune, the less you can hear yourself as a distinct vibration.

A perfectly tuned-in string can't be heard at all [on its own]. It only contributes to the overall volume and richness of the music.

Tune in!
